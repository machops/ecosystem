- OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`)
- Async job queue with priority scheduling (HIGH/NORMAL/LOW) and WebSocket status updates
- Model registry with lifecycle management and capability filtering
- Request queue with priority-based async dequeuing
- Pydantic v2 schemas for auth, inference, and model definitions
- API key + JWT authentication middleware with RBAC (admin/developer/viewer)

#### AI Service (`backend/ai/`)
