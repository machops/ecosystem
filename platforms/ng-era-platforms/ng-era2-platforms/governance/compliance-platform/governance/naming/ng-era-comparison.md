# Era-1, Era-2, Era-3 Comparison (NG Namespace Governance)

This document extends the existing NG namespace governance structure.
It does not overwrite or replace current governance files.

## Core Dimension Comparison

| Dimension | Era-1 | Era-2 | Era-3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Governance focus | Code layer | Service layer | Semantic layer |
| Structure | Static, predictable | Dynamic, distributed | Intent-driven, autonomous |
| Namespace ranges | NG000-299 | NG300-599 | NG600-899 |
| Primary objects | Packages, classes, methods, variables | Microservices, event streams, data pipelines | Business intent, semantic entities, autonomous agents |
| Governance style | Manual config + static checks | Dynamic coordination + distributed consistency | Closed-loop autonomy + intent reasoning |
| Traceability | Git history | Event streams + audit logs | Semantic graphs + reasoning chain |

## Era-1 (Code Era)

Characteristics:
- Clear hierarchy: package -> class -> method -> variable
- Language naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Static analysis and code review
- Git-based versioning

Limitations:
- No runtime dynamics
- No cross-service coordination
- No automated adaptation to business changes

## Era-2 (Microservice Era)

Characteristics:
- Explicit service boundaries and API contracts
- Event-driven integration
- Distributed coordination and service mesh
- Dynamic configuration

Capabilities:
- Cross-service coordination
- Runtime scaling and routing
- Distributed consistency
- Automated recovery

Limitations:
- Limited intent understanding
- Manual optimization decisions
- Limited cross-domain reasoning

## Era-3 (Semantic Autonomous Era)

Characteristics:
- Intent-first orchestration
- Semantic understanding over procedural steps
- Autonomous closed-loop control
- Knowledge-graph reasoning

Capabilities:
- Intent understanding
- Autonomous optimization and recovery
- Cross-domain reasoning
- Minimal human intervention

## Evolution Path

- Era-1 -> Era-2: static code governance to distributed service governance
- Era-2 -> Era-3: operational autonomy to intent-driven semantics

## NG Namespace Bridge

The NG namespace governance system is the bridge from Era-2 to Era-3 by:
- enforcing consistent naming
- enabling mapping between eras
- preserving traceability and auditability
