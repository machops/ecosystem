## Purpose

- Provide execution engine and runtime environment
- Schedule and orchestrate tasks
- Manage computational resources
- Organize files and artifacts

## Responsibilities

### Execution Engine Implementation
- Task execution and orchestration
- Workflow management
- Job scheduling
- Resource allocation

### Task Scheduling and Orchestration
- DAG-based task scheduling
- Parallel execution
- Dependency management
- Retry and error handling

## Key Components

### engine/
Core execution engine providing task orchestration and workflow management.

**Purpose**: Execute tasks and manage workflows
**Responsibilities**:
- Task scheduling and execution
- DAG-based workflow management
- Resource allocation and monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Parallel execution coordination

### file-organizer-system/
File organization and management system for file categorization and metadata management.

**Purpose**: Organize and manage files
**Responsibilities**:
- File categorization and tagging
- Metadata extraction and management
- Organization rule enforcement
- File lifecycle management

## Usage

### Task Execution
```python
# Execute tasks
from gl_execution_runtime.engine import Executor
executor = Executor()
result = executor.execute_task(task_config)
```

### Workflow Orchestration
```python
# Orchestrate workflows
from gl_execution_runtime.engine import WorkflowManager
manager = WorkflowManager()
manager.execute_workflow(workflow_config)
```

### File Organization
```python
# Organize files
from gl_execution_runtime.file_organizer_system import FileOrganizer
organizer = FileOrganizer()
organizer.organize_file(file_path, rules)
```

## Dependencies

**Outgoing**: GL50-59 (Observability), GL60-80 (Governance Compliance), GL81-83 (Extension Services), GL90-99 (Meta Specifications)

**Outgoing to**: None (bottom of execution stack)

## Interaction Rules

### Allowed Interactions
- ✅ Consume governance contracts from GL00-09
- ✅ Use platform services from GL10-29
- ✅ Consume data services from GL20-29
- ✅ Execute tasks and workflows
- ✅ Manage execution resources
- ✅ Orchestrate job execution
- ✅ Organize files and artifacts
- ✅ Publish metrics to observability

### Forbidden Interactions
- ❌ Process data streams directly
- ❌ Manage platform services
- ❌ Enforce governance policies
- ❌ Perform compliance checks

## Execution Standards

### Task Definition
```yaml
# Task Configuration
apiVersion: gl-execution/v1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: task-name
spec:
  executor: task-executor
  resources:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "512Mi"
  retryPolicy:
    maxRetries: 3
  timeout: 300s
```

### Workflow Definition
```yaml
# Workflow Configuration
apiVersion: gl-execution/v1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: workflow-name
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      dependsOn: []
    - name: task2
      dependsOn: [task1]
  parallelism: 4
```

## Compliance

This layer is **REGULATORY** - all execution must follow defined contracts and policies.

## Version

**Current Version**: 1.0.0
**Governance Level**: GL30-49
**Enforcement**: MANDATORY
