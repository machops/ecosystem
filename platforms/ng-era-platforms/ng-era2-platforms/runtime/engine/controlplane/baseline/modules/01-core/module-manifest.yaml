module_id: "01-core"
module_name: "Core Engine & Infrastructure"
module_description: |
  The Core Engine module provides the foundational infrastructure and cognitive processing capabilities
  for the MachineNativeOps platform. It handles system initialization, service registration, basic
  automation primitives, and the cognitive processor that enables AI-native operations. This module
  operates at L1-L2 autonomy levels, providing the essential building blocks upon which all other
  modules depend.
