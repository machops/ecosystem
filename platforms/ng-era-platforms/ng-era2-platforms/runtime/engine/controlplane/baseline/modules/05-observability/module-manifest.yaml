module_id: "05-observability"
module_name: "Observability & Monitoring System"
module_description: |
  The Observability & Monitoring System module provides comprehensive monitoring, alerting,
  and operational visibility across the entire platform. It operates at L4-L5 autonomy levels,
  enabling proactive detection of issues, automatic remediation, and semantic health monitoring.
  This module integrates metrics collection, logging, tracing, and intelligent anomaly detection
  to ensure system reliability and performance.
