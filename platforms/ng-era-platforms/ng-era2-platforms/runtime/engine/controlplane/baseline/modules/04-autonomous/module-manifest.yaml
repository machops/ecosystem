module_id: "04-autonomous"
module_name: "Autonomous Systems Framework"
module_description: |
  The Autonomous Systems Framework module provides the foundation for autonomous operations,
  implementing the five-skeleton architecture for unmanned/island scenarios. It operates at
  L4-L5 autonomy levels, enabling the system to function with minimal or no human intervention
  in controlled environments. This module includes autonomous decision-making, self-healing
  capabilities, and support for autonomous vehicles, drones, and edge computing scenarios.
