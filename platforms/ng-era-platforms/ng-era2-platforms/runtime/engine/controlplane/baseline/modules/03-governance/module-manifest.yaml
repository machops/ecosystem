module_id: "03-governance"
module_name: "Governance System & Policy Enforcement"
module_description: |
  The Governance System module provides comprehensive governance automation, policy enforcement,
  and semantic governance capabilities. It operates at L3-L4 autonomy levels, ensuring all
  operations comply with defined policies, maintaining semantic consistency, and providing
  audit trails for all system activities. This module implements Governance-as-Code and
  Policy-as-Code principles using OPA/Rego, with policy gates, semantic validation, and
  comprehensive audit logging.
