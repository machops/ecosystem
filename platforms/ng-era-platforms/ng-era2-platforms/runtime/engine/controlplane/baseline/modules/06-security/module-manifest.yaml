module_id: "06-security"
module_name: "Security & Supply Chain Governance"
module_description: |
  The Security & Supply Chain Governance module provides comprehensive security capabilities,
  supply chain integrity, and compliance enforcement. It operates at Global Layer (GL) with
  VETO authority across all system operations. This module implements SLSA provenance,
  SBOM management, artifact signing with Cosign, and comprehensive security auditing.
  It ensures end-to-end security from development to deployment and maintains compliance
  with industry standards.
