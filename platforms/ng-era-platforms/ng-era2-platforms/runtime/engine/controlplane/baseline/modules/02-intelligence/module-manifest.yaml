module_id: "02-intelligence"
module_name: "Intelligence Engine & Multi-Agent Collaboration"
module_description: |
  The Intelligence Engine module provides AI decision-making capabilities, multi-agent collaboration,
  and semantic understanding infrastructure. It operates at L2-L3 autonomy levels, enabling the system
  to make intelligent decisions, coordinate multiple agents, and maintain contextual awareness for
  complex task execution. This module leverages LLMs, knowledge graphs, and agent frameworks to
  achieve sophisticated automation and problem-solving capabilities.
