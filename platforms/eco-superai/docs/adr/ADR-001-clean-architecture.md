# ADR-001: Adopt Clean Architecture (Hexagonal)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-02-11  
**Deciders:** Platform Architecture Team

## Context

The eco-base Platform integrates multiple complex domains (quantum computing, AI/ML, scientific computing) that evolve at different rates and have distinct dependency profiles. We need an architecture that allows each domain to evolve independently while maintaining a cohesive system.

## Decision

We adopt **Clean Architecture** (Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters) with the following layer structure:

1. **Domain Layer** — Pure business logic, zero external dependencies
2. **Application Layer** — Use case orchestration, depends only on Domain
3. **Infrastructure Layer** — External adapters (DB, cache, APIs), implements Domain ports
4. **Presentation Layer** — HTTP API, depends on Application layer

Quantum, AI, and Scientific modules are treated as **peer domain modules** at the same level as the core domain.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Domain logic is fully testable without infrastructure
- Modules can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Technology choices (DB, cache, quantum backend) can be swapped without domain changes
- Clear dependency boundaries prevent accidental coupling

### Negative
- More boilerplate code (interfaces, DTOs, mappers)
- Steeper learning curve for new developers
- Risk of over-engineering simple CRUD operations

### Mitigations
- Provide code generators for common patterns
- Document conventions thoroughly in Developer Guide
- Allow pragmatic shortcuts for simple operations with explicit tech-debt markers
