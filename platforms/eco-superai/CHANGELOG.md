## [0.1.0] — 2025-02-11

### Added

- **Project Scaffold**: Complete Clean Architecture directory structure with presentation, application, domain, infrastructure layers.
- **FastAPI Application**: Entry point with versioned API routes for health, users, quantum, AI, scientific, and admin endpoints.
- **Quantum Computing Module**: Runtime executor abstraction with VQE, QAOA, and QML algorithm implementations via Qiskit/Cirq backends.
- **AI/ML Module**: Expert factory pattern, task executor agents, vector database manager (ChromaDB/Qdrant), and embedding generator.
- **Scientific Computing Module**: Matrix operations, statistical analysis, signal processing, interpolation, calculus, and optimization solvers.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: PostgreSQL persistence with SQLAlchemy, Redis cache client, application settings via Pydantic.
- **Domain Layer**: Base entity with UUID/timestamp support, User entity, repository interfaces, and specification pattern.
- **Docker Compose**: Full local development stack with PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Prometheus, Grafana, and application service.
- **Dockerfile.prod**: Multi-stage production Docker build with security hardening (non-root user, minimal image).
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Base deployment and service definitions with resource limits, health probes, and security context.
- **Helm Chart**: Parameterized Helm chart with configurable replicas, resources, ingress, and autoscaling.
- **ArgoCD Application**: GitOps application manifest for automated deployment synchronization.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with lint, test, build, security scan, and deploy stages.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus configuration with scrape targets and alerting rules for API latency, error rates, and resource usage.
- **Testing Framework**: Unit test structure for domain entities and quantum module with pytest configuration.
- **Developer Tools**: Health check utility and YAML-to-JSON converter.
- **Configuration**: Environment variable template (.env.example), pyproject.toml with full dependency specification.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with architecture overview, quick start guide, and deployment instructions.
- **Makefile**: Developer command interface covering setup, testing, quality, Docker, Helm, Terraform, and utilities.

### Architecture Decisions

- Adopted Clean Architecture (Hexagonal) for maximum modularity and testability.
- Chose FastAPI for async-first API performance with automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- Implemented quantum runtime abstraction to support multiple backends (Qiskit Aer, IBM Quantum, Cirq).
- Used Pydantic Settings for type-safe, validated configuration management.
- Designed vector database integration as a pluggable adapter (ChromaDB default, Qdrant optional).
