# Mapping Delta

- ARCHITECTURE.md keeps ECO deployment map: eco-core, eco-govops, eco-seccompops, eco-dataops, eco-eco-base, eco-observops.
- platforms/README.md keeps GL marketplace map: gl.{domain}.{capability}-platform catalog + legacy ng-era note.
- Delta status: dual-catalog structure confirmed; cross-reference required in retrieval index for operator awareness.
