## Overview

eco-base is a production-grade AI inference platform that routes requests across 7 engine backends (vLLM, TGI, Ollama, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, DeepSpeed, LMDeploy) with automatic failover, circuit breaking, and connection pooling. It provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints, .qyaml governance enforcement, and Argo CD GitOps deployment.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Multi-engine inference** with automatic failover across 7 backends
- **OpenAI-compatible API** (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`)
- **Async job queue** with priority scheduling and WebSocket status updates
- **Vector alignment** via quantum-bert-xxl-v1 (1024-4096 dimensions)
- **.qyaml governance** with 5-phase validation and persistent audit trail
- **Argo CD GitOps** with self-healing staging and manual production sync
- **Full observability** (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Loki)
- **500 tests** across unit, integration, and E2E suites

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/indestructibleorg/eco-base.git
cd eco-base

# Install Python deps
pip install pydantic fastapi httpx pytest pytest-asyncio jsonschema pyyaml numpy

# Run tests (500 passing)
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -v

# Run CI validator
python3 tools/ci-validator/validate.py

# Full stack (Docker Compose)
cp .env.example .env.local
docker compose up -d

# Verify
curl http://localhost:8001/health   # AI service
curl http://localhost:3000/health   # API gateway
open http://localhost:5173          # Web frontend
```

### Infrastructure placement guidance

- Keep **shared infrastructure** at repository root (`supabase/`, `k8s/`, `helm/`) so CI/integration tooling has one canonical path.
- Keep **service-owned infrastructure** near the service code (`backend/cloudflare/`, `backend/k8s/`) until that service is split into a standalone platform.
- If a platform becomes independently extractable, move its infra to `platforms/<platform>/...` instead of creating more `backend/*` shared paths.

## Inference Engines

| Engine | Features | Default Port |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| vLLM | PagedAttention, continuous batching, prefix caching | 8100 |
| TGI | Token streaming, watermarking, flash attention | 8101 |
| SGLang | RadixAttention, structured generation | 8102 |
| TensorRT-LLM | INT8/FP8 quantization, multi-GPU | 8103 |
| DeepSpeed | ZeRO inference, pipeline parallelism | 8104 |
| LMDeploy | TurboMind, persistent batch | 8105 |
| Ollama | Local models, pull-on-demand | 11434 |

All adapters implement a unified interface (`BaseInferenceAdapter`) with `generate()`, `stream()`, `health_check()`, and `list_models()`. The `EngineManager` provides automatic failover: if the preferred engine fails, it routes to the next healthy engine.

## CI/CD

5-gate pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`):

| Gate | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | validate | CI Validator Engine (8 validators) |
| 2 | lint | Python compile + JS syntax + YAML governance |
| 3 | test | 500 tests (unit + integration + e2e + skill) |
| 4 | build | Docker build + structure verification |
| 5 | auto-fix | Diagnostic mode on failure |
