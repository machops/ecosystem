# eco-base Architecture

URI: eco-base://docs/ARCHITECTURE

## System Overview

eco-base is an enterprise cloud-native AI platform built as a mono-repository. It provides multi-engine inference routing across 7 engine backends, .qyaml governance enforcement, Argo CD GitOps deployment, and a full observability stack. The platform is designed for high availability with circuit breakers, connection pooling, automatic failover, and self-healing infrastructure.

## Component Layers

The system is organized into six dependency layers. Each layer depends only on layers below it.

### Layer 0: Schema & Types

Shared data contracts that all other layers depend on. Changes here propagate everywhere.

| Component | Path | Language | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Pydantic Schemas | `src/schemas/` | Python | `auth.py` (UserRole, APIKeyCreate/Info/Result), `inference.py` (ChatCompletionRequest/Response, UsageInfo, ChatMessage, ChatRole), `models.py` (ModelFormat, ModelCapability, ModelStatus, ModelRegisterRequest, QuantizationConfig, ModelHardwareRequirements) |
| Shared Types | `packages/shared-types/src/` | TypeScript | `entities/` (user.ts, platform.ts, ai.ts, yaml.ts), `api/` (requests.ts, responses.ts) |
| gRPC Stubs | `backend/shared/proto/generated/` | Python | Dataclass-based lightweight stubs matching proto message interfaces |
| API Types | `backend/api/src/types.ts` | TypeScript | ServiceHealth, PaginatedResponse, ErrorResponse, JobStatus, AIGenerateRequest/Response, YAMLGenerateRequest |

### Layer 1: Core Business Logic

Stateless business logic modules used by multiple services.

| Component | Path | LOC | Description |

| Auth Middleware | `src/middleware/auth.py` | 172 | API key lifecycle (create/revoke/rotate), JWT validation, rate limiting per key, role-based access (admin/developer/viewer) |
| Model Registry | `src/core/registry.py` | 213 | Central model catalog with 6 default models, resolve by ID/capability, filter by engine compatibility, lifecycle management (register/unload/retire) |
| Request Queue | `src/core/queue.py` | 145 | Priority-based async queue (HIGH/NORMAL/LOW), depth tracking, dequeue with timeout, queue statistics |

### Layer 2: Service Integration

Stateful services that manage connections, pools, and background tasks.

**AI Service (`backend/ai/src/services/`):**

| Service | LOC | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `engine_manager.py` | 280+ | Orchestrates 7 engine adapters. Initializes connection pools and circuit breakers per engine. Provides `generate()` with automatic failover: tries preferred engine, falls back through healthy alternatives. Tracks per-engine health metrics. |
| `circuit_breaker.py` | ~120 | Three-state machine (CLOSED -> OPEN -> HALF_OPEN). Configurable failure threshold and recovery timeout. Per-engine isolation prevents cascade failures. |
| `connection_pool.py` | ~100 | Persistent `httpx.AsyncClient` pool per engine endpoint. Configurable pool size, timeouts, and keepalive. Shared across all requests to an engine. |
| `worker.py` | ~250 | Async inference job queue with priority scheduling (HIGH/NORMAL/LOW). Job lifecycle: submit -> poll -> complete/fail/cancel. Stale job cleanup. Expiry enforcement. |

## Inference Engine Adapters

All adapters implement `BaseInferenceAdapter` (defined in `backend/ai/engines/inference/base.py`) providing a unified interface: `generate()`, `stream()`, `health_check()`, `list_models()`, and optional `embeddings()`.

| Engine | Adapter Path | Features |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| vLLM | `adapters/vllm_adapter.py` | PagedAttention for efficient KV-cache, continuous batching, prefix caching, tensor parallelism for multi-GPU |
| TGI | `adapters/tgi_adapter.py` | Token streaming, watermarking, flash attention |
| Ollama | `adapters/ollama_adapter.py` | Local model management, pull-on-demand, CPU/GPU inference |
| SGLang | `adapters/sglang_adapter.py` | RadixAttention, structured generation, constrained decoding |
| TensorRT-LLM | `adapters/tensorrt_adapter.py` | INT8/FP8 quantization, multi-GPU pipeline parallelism, in-flight batching |
| DeepSpeed | `adapters/deepspeed_adapter.py` | ZeRO inference, pipeline parallelism, kernel injection |
| LMDeploy | `adapters/lmdeploy_adapter.py` | TurboMind backend, persistent batch scheduling |

**Resilience Layer** (`backend/ai/engines/inference/resilience.py`):

Every adapter request passes through the resilience layer which provides:

1. **Connection Pool**: Persistent `httpx.AsyncClient` per adapter (avoids connection setup overhead)
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Per-adapter CLOSED -> OPEN -> HALF_OPEN state machine. Opens after N consecutive failures, auto-recovers after timeout.
3. **Retry**: Exponential backoff (base 0.5s, max 8s, multiplier 2x). 4xx errors fail-fast (no retry). 5xx and connection errors retry up to 2 times.

## Compute, Folding, and Index Engines

Beyond inference, the platform includes specialized engine categories:

**Compute Engines** (`backend/ai/engines/compute/`):

| Engine | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `similarity.py` | Cosine similarity, dot product, Euclidean distance between vectors |
| `ranking.py` | Relevance ranking with BM25 and vector-based scoring |
| `clustering.py` | K-means, DBSCAN clustering on embedding spaces |
| `reasoning.py` | Chain-of-thought reasoning pipeline |

**Folding Engines** (`backend/ai/engines/folding/`):

| Engine | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vector_folding.py` | 3-tier embed priority (EmbeddingService -> sentence-transformers -> hash fallback). Injects `embedding_service` for engine-backed embeddings. |
| `graph_folding.py` | Graph-based knowledge folding |
| `hybrid_folding.py` | Combined vector + graph folding |
| `realtime_index.py` | WAL-backed realtime index updater. Append-only JSONL write-ahead log with `recover_from_wal()` for crash recovery. |

**Index Engines** (`backend/ai/engines/index/`):

| Engine | Config Prefix | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `faiss_index.py` | `ECO_FAISS_*` | FAISS vector index (IVFFlat, GPU support, persistent storage) |
| `elasticsearch_index.py` | `ECO_ES_*` | Elasticsearch hybrid search (vector + keyword) |
| `neo4j_index.py` | `ECO_NEO4J_*` | Neo4j graph index for relationship queries |
| `hybrid_router.py` | - | Routes queries to optimal index based on query type |

## Governance Architecture

All `.qyaml` manifests must contain four governance blocks. Validation is enforced at three levels:

1. **GovernanceEngine** (`backend/ai/src/governance.py`, 400 LOC): YAML-parse validation via `yaml.safe_load_all`. 5-phase pipeline: YAML parse -> block check -> field check -> GKE compatibility -> semantic validation. Persistent audit log (append-only JSONL with rotation).

2. **OPA Policies** (`policy/qyaml_governance.rego`): Rego-based policy enforcement for CI/CD gates.

3. **CI Validator** (`tools/ci-validator/validate.py`): 8-validator engine run in CI pipeline gate 1.

**Required Governance Blocks:**

| Block | Required Fields | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| `document_metadata` | `unique_id` (UUID v1), `uri`, `urn`, `target_system`, `schema_version`, `generated_by`, `created_at` | Document identity and traceability |
| `governance_info` | `owner`, `compliance_tags`, `lifecycle_policy` | Ownership and compliance |
| `registry_binding` | `service_endpoint`, `health_check_path` | Service discovery integration |
| `vector_alignment_map` | `alignment_model`, `coherence_vector_dim` | Vector space alignment |

See [.qyaml Governance Specification](QYAML_GOVERNANCE.md) for the complete specification.

## Data Flow: Chat Completion Request

```
1. Client sends POST /v1/chat/completions
   |
2. Root Gateway (src/app.py)
   |- AuthMiddleware validates API key
   |- ServiceProxy.forward() to AI service
   |
3. AI Service (backend/ai/src/routes.py)
   |- _resolve_model_id() via ModelRegistry
   |- _generate_via_engine() dispatches to EngineManager
   |
4. EngineManager (backend/ai/src/services/engine_manager.py)
   |- Selects preferred engine from MODEL_ENGINE_MAP
   |- Checks CircuitBreaker.allow_request()
   |- Gets httpx.AsyncClient from ConnectionPool
   |
5. Engine Adapter (e.g., vllm_adapter.py)
   |- Builds engine-native payload
   |- Sends HTTP request to engine endpoint
   |- Parses response into InferenceResponse
   |
6. Response flows back through layers
   |- EngineManager records success/failure
   |- Routes formats OpenAI-compatible response
   |- Gateway returns to client
```

**Failover Path:**

If the preferred engine fails (circuit open or HTTP error), EngineManager iterates through remaining healthy engines in order. If all engines fail, returns 503 with degraded status.

## Resilience Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Implementation | Scope |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Circuit Breaker | `services/circuit_breaker.py` + `engines/inference/resilience.py` | Per-engine, CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN |
| Connection Pool | `services/connection_pool.py` + `engines/inference/resilience.py` | Per-engine persistent httpx.AsyncClient |
| Retry | `engines/inference/resilience.py` + `services/ai-proxy.ts` | Exponential backoff, 4xx fail-fast |
| Health Monitor | `services/health_monitor.py` | Periodic probing, degraded mode detection |
| WAL | `engines/folding/realtime_index.py` | Append-only JSONL, crash recovery |
| Job Queue | `services/worker.py` | Priority scheduling, stale cleanup, cancellation |
| Audit Log | `governance.py` AuditPersistence | Append-only JSONL with rotation |

## CI/CD Pipeline

5-gate pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` (344 LOC):

| Gate | Name | Checks |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | validate | CI Validator Engine (8 validators), .qyaml governance |
| 2 | lint | Python `py_compile` (all .py files), JS syntax check, YAML governance, skill validation |
| 3 | test | 448 tests (unit + integration + e2e + skill) |
| 4 | build | Docker build, repository structure verification (42+ dirs, 24+ files) |
| 5 | auto-fix | Diagnostic mode on failure (runs `auto-fix.py`) |
